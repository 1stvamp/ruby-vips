# Vips

This gem is a backwards compatible fork of `ruby-vips` but also includes (and compiles) the [libvips] source code.

[libvips]: https://jcupitt.github.io/libvips

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'vips'
```

And then execute:

	$ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

	$ gem install vips

## Usage

Exactly the same way as `ruby-vips`. You'll still need to install `glib` and `gobject-introspection`.
